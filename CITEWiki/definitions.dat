ArrayArrayLinear∑An array is a structure representing a fixed length ordered collection of values or objects with the same type. Arrays make it easier to organize and operate on large amounts of data.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearÚA binary search tree is defined as a tree where each node can have no more than two children. By limiting the number of children to 2, we can write efficient programs for inserting data, deleting data, and searching for data in a binary tree.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearØA graph is a non-linear data structure trumped-up of nodes and edges. Edges are lines or arcs that link any two nodes in a graph, and nodes are also called vertices. A graph can be more explicitly defined as, A graph comprises a finite number of vertices (or nodes) and a set of Edges that connect them.
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearòA Hash Table represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key. It uses the key to access the elements in the collection. A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value.HeapTree
Non-Linear±The purpose of the heap is to store data that needs to outlive specific methods. This means the heap is used to store reference type variables, which are referred to as objects.Linked ListListLinear≠A Linked List is a linear data structure which consists of a group of nodes in a sequence. Each node contains two parts. Data‚àí Each node of a linked list can store a data.ListListLinear«A list is a collection of strongly typed objects. These objects can be easily accessed using their respective index. Index calling gives the flexibility to sort, search, and modify lists if required.QueueAbstractLinearêThe C# queue is a FIFO queue collection class in the System. Collection namespace. Storing elements in FIFO style (First In, First Out), the C# queue contains elements in precisely the order they were added, with objects added at one end and removed from the opposite end.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearöA self-balance tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.SetAbstract
Non-LinearﬁThe set keyword defines an accessor method in a property or indexer that assigns a value to the property or the indexer element. For more information and examples, see Properties, Auto-Implemented Properties, and Indexers.StackAbstractLinearûIn C#, stacks are used to store a collection of objects in a LIFO (Last in, First out) style, i.e., the element which added last will come out first. By using the Push() method, you can add elements to the stack. The Pop() method will remove and return a topmost element from the stack.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearõA two-dimensional array consists of single-dimensional arrays as its elements. It can be represented as a table with a specific number of rows and columns.
